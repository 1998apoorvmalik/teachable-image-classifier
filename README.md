# Teachable Machine Classifier

## Introduction

Inspired by Googleâ€™s teachable machines, I created my own version of this project. The frontend is created with the Flutter, and the backend is coded with Python (Tensorflow, Flask, Socket IO).

To run this project, you must have both flutter and anaconda installed.

## Getting Started

First Clone this repository.

Now copy & paste this code in your terminal to create a new conda environment, install all the required dependencies, and finally to start the backend.

```test
cd teachable_image_classifier
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate teachable-image-classifier
python backend/app.py
```

You can now build the flutter app for Desktop/MacOS/Linux.
